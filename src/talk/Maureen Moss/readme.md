Foundational Hormones
 
Guest Dr. Raymond Peat, Ph.D. in Biology, www.raypeat.com
Author of Nutrition for Women, four editions, 1975 to 1993.
Mind and Tissue, two editions, 1976 and 1994.
Progesterone in Orthomolecular Medicine, two editions, 1980 and 1994.
Generative Energy, 1994.
From PMS to Menopause: Female Hormones in Context. According to Peat the subject of female sexuality and health scientifically means going against the current of both conventional medicine and alternative medicine.
U.S. Patents: progesterone in tocopherol, 1984, DHEA and other steroids for arthritis, 1986, and the use of steroids in treatment of osteoporosis and other degenerative diseases.
 
Topics:
What are Foundational Hormones? Progesterone and Pregnenolone
 
Aging, estrogen, and progesterone.
 
Estrogen Dominance the "Hormonal Hell" and how it masquerades under serious conditions
 
Cholesterol, good or bad, we need it for dealing with stress, everyday stress as your brain needs it to function
 
Why we need cholesterol? It synthesizes Foundational Hormones -- progesterone and pregnenolone that makes everything else that we need for coping with stress. Why would we avoid it? Unless 'biochemical insanity' has been mass marketed to us so we keep the cholesterol reducing industries in business.
 
DHEA the youthing hormone. When to DHEA and when not to DHEA that is the question
Ray Peat provides the following information on the effects of DHEA.
 
Libido: In men who have decreased testosterone production resulting in decreased libido, DHEA, which can convert to testosterone, boosted libido almost as well as testosterone.
 
Osteoporosis: Dr. John Lee documented six years of research, which showed the reversal of osteoporosis with progesterone.
 
Peat ate some DHEA, not much, only several milligrams daily. He noticed the following:

A mole fell off! Other patients had the same results.
Wisdom teeth impacted 20 years prior rotated into position.
Peat grew 1 1/2 inches at the age of 46. His weight stayed the same but his waist size decreased. In a few weeks, perhaps ten, he lost his middle age appearance because he got taller!
Topical application of DHEA on his gray hair caused its original color to return!
WARNING ON DHEA: Peat no longer offers DHEA because he believes that, in the wrong hormonal environment, e.g., low progesterone and/or low thyroid hormones, DHEA can convert to estrogen and testosterone. In women with cystic ovaries, DHEA can convert to estrogen.
